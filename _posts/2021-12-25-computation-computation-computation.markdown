Computations run our world. They are behind most of mankind's greatest
accomplishments. Whatever the sector health, transport, military, commerce, and
education, computations have been catalysts and accelerants for change. The
change has been either good or bad depending on the motive and goals of those who
leverage these computations. As computers became more powerful, we were so
enamored at what things they can do, and not what things they should do for the
benefit of the human race. I argue computations behind software and hardware
should work to spur growth in people's lives. Only when we actively seek to do
this, do we see results. Specifity is a thing.
