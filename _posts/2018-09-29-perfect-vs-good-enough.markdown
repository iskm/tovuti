Perfection is and will always be a moving target for us. I advice anyone to not
chase after it, however set short, attainable, time-constrained goals that lead to good. You will be
more efficient in the long run. For example, as a freshman in college,
i strived to write the perfect paper in my English class, often spending extra
hours to accomplish this. The extra time, i invested would have been better spent on other classes or my hobbies.
I could have read that chapter for calculus or worked on that embedded project
that i was very interested on. My insistness on perfection took that time away.
Don't get me wrong, i'm not saying perfection is a bad thing, but i'm saying
its expensive. Strive for good work always with the occasional sprinkle of
perfect.
