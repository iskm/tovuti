I got started with **ubuntu** a long time ago due to its notoriety as a platform
where everything works. It's still the case! With the advent of
technologies like flatpak and containers, other linux distributions are
viable. I'm taking a break from Ubuntu to experience other distributions, as
well as:
- get acquainted with other package management. Thanks apt, dpkg and .deb!!
- i'm torn on the direction with snaps, when flatpak exists
- expose myself to different cultures in other distros

I've dabbled with **fedora** a lot over the years, but have now completely
transitioned to it. The community, the speed of updates, documentation and
developer focus are simply impressive. For now goodbye ubuntu my good old
friend ```apt install -y vim-nox git```, hello **fedora** my energetic new pal ```dnf
install -y vim-enhanced git```
