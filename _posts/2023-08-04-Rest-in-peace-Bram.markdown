I like many others have fallen in love with vim. From its of use, to
keybindings that just make sense and are easy on the hands. Its a joy to
write, code and create in vim.

Bram was also involved with a lot of charity. Donating a lot through vim
towards projects in Africa for example.

To Bram, A great human and coder, may your soul rest in peace. We will miss
you. His ideals and values live on through vim and those of us that've found
a home in vim ```:wq```
