Hi,

  Welcome to my little corner of the internet. Here, I'll talk tech,
life, and anything that passes my mind as interesting. I was born, and
raised in [Tanzania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanzania). Tanzania is home
to many things: its people, the classic big five, the islands of Zanzibar and of course mount
Kilimanjaro! The blog's name,
Nyumbani, is a swahili word for home.
